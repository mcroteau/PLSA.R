if they masterbated as kid a lot that means they were missing something as a child, maybe their mother didn't hold them and love them the way they needed
if they are missing something they have a whole in their heart
you got to know that they will love deeply and be committed 100%
the catch is if you are whimsical, and hes not, then you shouldn't pretend or try. for you, your kids, your kids kids.
im ok, i hope nothing but the greatest for you

dont pay attention to that, thats how i figure out evil

there are women out there that suggest you need to screw someone in order to break the chain, but that could lead to something else bad
a suggestion
before becoming intimate with someone you do this: ask yourself what percent compatibility is he with me? then, make a decision to "do it".
another suggestion, he should be in the 70+% range before doing anything, even a kiss.
