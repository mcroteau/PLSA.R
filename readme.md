# âˆ† PLSAR

PLSAR is an Open Source Server + Framework Environment 
for small to large scale requirements. There are no static 
references, no file reads, reference to static fields per request. 
Everything is either cached and or instantiated on the fly. 
PLSAR runs via one command so there are no .war files to deploy, 
no additional plugins to install it is a simple yet powerful 
alternative to container deployment environments.

We don't have official stats but it is estimated that PLSAR 
can handle 90,000 concurrent connections per second.

We even perform a lightweight dependency injection routine so you are not 
stuck boiler-plating. 
We followed Spring so everything should be familiar.
